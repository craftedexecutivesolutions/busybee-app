APPROVAL OF MINUTES:
CHAIR MARTINEZ: The first item on our agenda is the approval of minutes from our October 18th, 2024 regular meeting. Everyone should have received copies via email. Are there any corrections or additions to the minutes?

DR. WILLIAMS: I have one small correction. On page 3, under the scholarship committee report, it should read "fifteen applications" not "fifty applications."

SECRETARY CHEN: Thank you, Patricia. I'll make that correction.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Any other corrections? Hearing none, I need a motion to approve the minutes as corrected.

TREASURER RODRIGUEZ: I move to approve the minutes of October 18th, 2024 as corrected.

MR. ANDERSON: I second the motion.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: We have a motion and a second. All in favor?

ALL MEMBERS: Aye.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: The motion passes unanimously. The minutes are approved as corrected.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S REPORT:
CHAIR MARTINEZ: Next, we'll hear the Executive Director's report. Amanda?

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOSTER: Thank you, Jennifer. I'm pleased to report that our fall fundraising campaign exceeded expectations. We raised $127,000, which is 15% above our goal of $110,000. The community response was outstanding, with 234 new donors joining our foundation family.

Our three major programs are all running smoothly. The youth leadership program has 45 participants this semester, the senior nutrition program is serving an average of 180 meals per week, and our emergency assistance fund has helped 23 families this quarter.

I also want to inform the board that we've received a potential major gift inquiry from the Riverside Trust. They're considering a $250,000 grant for our educational initiatives. I'll be meeting with their representatives next week.

Are there any questions about my report?

DR. WILLIAMS: Amanda, do we have demographic data on our new donors?

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOSTER: Yes, I can provide that breakdown at the next meeting. Preliminary data shows good diversity across age groups and geographic areas within our service region.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Thank you, Amanda. Any other questions? 

TREASURER'S REPORT:
CHAIR MARTINEZ: Michael, please give us the treasurer's report.

TREASURER RODRIGUEZ: Thank you, Jennifer. Our financial position remains strong. As of October 31st, we have $1.2 million in our operating fund and $3.8 million in our endowment fund. 

Our year-to-date expenses are tracking at 87% of budget, which puts us in a favorable position for the year-end. Investment returns for the third quarter were 4.2%, outperforming our benchmark by 0.8%.

I do want to bring to the board's attention that our insurance premiums will increase by 12% for the next fiscal year. David has been working with our broker to find the best coverage options.

The complete financial statements are in your board packets. Are there any questions?

MS. PARK: Michael, what's driving the insurance premium increase?

TREASURER RODRIGUEZ: It's primarily liability insurance. Our coverage limits have increased, and the insurance market has been challenging this year across the nonprofit sector.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Thank you, Michael. Any other questions about the financial report?

OLD BUSINESS:
CHAIR MARTINEZ: Moving to old business. At our last meeting, we tabled the discussion about the strategic planning consultant proposal. Robert, would you like to update us on the committee's work?

VICE CHAIR THOMPSON: Yes, thank you. The strategic planning committee met twice since our last board meeting. We interviewed three consulting firms and are prepared to make a recommendation.

After careful evaluation, we recommend hiring Strategic Vision Partners for $45,000 to facilitate our strategic planning process over the next six months. They have extensive experience with foundations our size and came highly recommended by the Regional Association of Grantmakers.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Thank you, Robert. The floor is open for discussion.

DR. WILLIAMS: I reviewed all three proposals. Strategic Vision Partners clearly understood our mission and had the most comprehensive approach.

MR. ANDERSON: I agree. Their timeline also works well with our grant cycle schedule.

MS. PARK: My only concern is the cost. Is $45,000 within our budget?

TREASURER RODRIGUEZ: Yes, we budgeted $50,000 for strategic planning this fiscal year.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Any other discussion? Hearing none, I need a motion.

VICE CHAIR THOMPSON: I move that the board approve hiring Strategic Vision Partners to facilitate our strategic planning process for a fee not to exceed $45,000.

DR. WILLIAMS: I second the motion.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: We have a motion and second. Any further discussion? Hearing none, all in favor?

SIX MEMBERS: Aye.

MS. PARK: I abstain.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: The motion passes with six yes votes and one abstention.

NEW BUSINESS:
CHAIR MARTINEZ: We have two items under new business. First is the proposed revision to our grant-making policy.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOSTER: The proposed changes would streamline our application process and allow for multi-year grants up to three years for established partners. This would reduce administrative burden on both applicants and our staff.

The key changes are outlined in the memo in your packets. The program committee unanimously recommends these revisions.

MR. ANDERSON: I think these changes make sense. We've heard from several grantees that our process is quite lengthy.

DR. WILLIAMS: I support the multi-year grants, but I want to ensure we maintain proper oversight.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOSTER: Absolutely. Multi-year grants would include annual reporting requirements and site visits.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Any other discussion?

MS. PARK: I move to approve the revised grant-making policy as presented.

MR. ANDERSON: Second.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Motion and second. All in favor?

ALL MEMBERS: Aye.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Motion passes unanimously.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: The second item under new business is the nomination of new board members. As you know, we have two board positions that will be open when Dr. Williams and James complete their terms in June.

The nominating committee has identified three potential candidates. Sarah, would you present the committee's report?

SECRETARY CHEN: Thank you. We've identified three outstanding candidates: Maria Gonzalez, a CPA with nonprofit experience; Dr. Kevin Park, a local physician involved in community health initiatives; and Janet Mitchell, who runs a successful local business and has been very active in our volunteer programs.

All three have expressed strong interest in serving. We recommend interviewing all three candidates and selecting two to join the board.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Thank you, Sarah. What's the committee's proposed timeline?

SECRETARY CHEN: We'd like to conduct interviews in December and make recommendations at our January meeting for approval.

DR. WILLIAMS: I think it's important that we maintain the professional expertise we'll be losing when Michael and I rotate off.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Agreed. Any objection to the committee proceeding with interviews? Hearing none, please proceed.

EXECUTIVE SESSION:
CHAIR MARTINEZ: At this time, I'd like to move into executive session to discuss personnel matters. Amanda, David, and Maria, thank you for joining us today.

[Executive Director and staff departed at 4:15 PM]

CHAIR MARTINEZ: We're now in executive session at 4:16 PM to discuss the Executive Director's annual performance review.

[Executive session discussion - confidential]

CHAIR MARTINEZ: I'm calling us back to open session at 4:35 PM. During executive session, the board completed Amanda's annual performance review. I move that we approve a 4% salary increase for Amanda effective January 1st, 2025, reflecting her excellent performance.

TREASURER RODRIGUEZ: Second.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: All in favor?

ALL MEMBERS: Aye.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Motion passes unanimously.

ANNOUNCEMENTS:
CHAIR MARTINEZ: Are there any announcements?

SECRETARY CHEN: Just a reminder that our holiday reception is December 12th at 6:00 PM at the Community Center.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOSTER: The annual impact report will be ready for review at our next meeting.

ADJOURNMENT:
CHAIR MARTINEZ: Is there any other business? Hearing none, I need a motion to adjourn.

MR. ANDERSON: I move to adjourn.

MS. PARK: Second.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: All in favor?

ALL MEMBERS: Aye.

CHAIR MARTINEZ: Meeting adjourned at 4:38 PM. Our next regular meeting is scheduled for December 20th, 2024 at 3:00 PM.

SARAH: Alright everyone, welcome to our Digital Marketing Strategies Workshop. Thanks for taking time out of your busy schedules. Today we're going to dive deep into our Q1 2025 digital marketing plan and talk about some new strategies we want to implement.

I've prepared an agenda, but I want this to be interactive. Feel free to jump in with questions or ideas as we go. Our main goals today are to review our current performance, identify opportunities for improvement, and align on our strategy for the new quarter.

Let's start with where we are right now. David, can you walk us through the analytics from Q4?

DAVID: Sure thing. So looking at our overall digital performance, we're seeing some interesting trends. Our website traffic is up 23% compared to last quarter, which is great. Most of that growth is coming from organic search - our SEO efforts are really paying off.

Social media engagement is a mixed bag. Instagram is performing really well, up 40% in engagement rate. LinkedIn is steady, which is good for our B2B content. But Facebook is declining, which isn't surprising given the changing demographics there.

Email marketing is our star performer though. Emily, you should be proud - our open rates are at 34%, which is way above industry average of 21%. Click-through rates are at 4.8%.

EMILY: Thanks! We've been really focused on segmentation and personalization. The automated drip campaigns for new leads are working particularly well.

SARAH: That's fantastic. What about conversion rates?

DAVID: That's where we have room for improvement. Traffic is up, engagement is good, but our conversion rate has actually dropped slightly to 2.1% from 2.4% last quarter. We're getting more visitors but they're not converting as well.

LISA: I think that might be related to the content experience. We've been driving traffic with top-of-funnel content, but maybe we need better middle and bottom-funnel pieces to guide people through the journey.

MIKE: That makes sense. From a product marketing perspective, I've noticed prospects are asking more detailed questions before they convert. They want more proof points, case studies, that kind of thing.

SARAH: Good insights. Let's put that on our list of opportunities. Now, I want to talk about some new strategies for Q1. I've been researching video marketing - it's something we've dabbled in but haven't fully committed to.

The stats are compelling. Video content gets 1200% more shares than text and images combined. And our target audience is consuming more video content than ever.

JAMES: I love this idea. From a social media standpoint, video performs so much better. Our few Instagram Reels get way more engagement than static posts. And LinkedIn is really pushing video content in the algorithm.

JENNIFER: What about the brand consistency though? We'd need to establish video guidelines, templates, maybe even hire a videographer.

SARAH: Good point. I actually got quotes from three video agencies. We're looking at about $15,000 per month for professional video content - two to three videos per week, plus editing and optimization.

MIKE: That seems reasonable considering the potential impact. What types of videos are we thinking?

SARAH: I'm thinking a mix. Product demos, customer testimonials, behind-the-scenes content, and educational pieces. Maybe a monthly series featuring our team members as thought leaders.

EMILY: Could we repurpose the video content for email campaigns? I think video thumbnails in emails could boost our click rates even more.

SARAH: Absolutely. That's the beauty of video - one piece of content can be used across multiple channels.

DAVID: We should set up proper tracking for video metrics. View completion rates, engagement by video length, that sort of thing.

SARAH: Great point. Now, the other big initiative I want to discuss is marketing automation. We're using some basic automation now, but I think we could be much more sophisticated.

EMILY: Yes! I've been wanting to expand beyond just email automation. We could set up behavioral triggers, lead scoring, automated content recommendations.

LISA: What platform are we thinking? HubSpot, Pardot, something else?

SARAH: I've been evaluating options. HubSpot seems like the best fit for our size and needs. It's about $800 per month for the features we'd need, but it would replace two of our current tools, so the net cost increase is only about $300.

MIKE: The lead scoring would be huge for sales enablement. Right now sales is getting all leads, but we could filter and prioritize based on behavior and engagement.

DAVID: And the attribution reporting would be much better. We'd finally be able to track the full customer journey from first touch to closed deal.

SARAH: Exactly. I think this could really transform how we work with sales. Speaking of which, that brings me to our next topic - content strategy.

Lisa, I know you've been thinking about our content calendar for Q1.

LISA: Right, so building on what we discussed about the conversion issue, I think we need to restructure our content approach. We're great at awareness-stage content, but we're missing that crucial consideration and decision-stage content.

I'm proposing we shift to a 40-30-30 split. Forty percent awareness content to keep driving traffic, but thirty percent consideration content like comparison guides and case studies, and thirty percent decision-stage content like demos and free trials.

JENNIFER: That sounds smart. From a brand perspective, the case studies would really help establish credibility and trust.

MIKE: And I can help with the technical aspects of comparison content. We need to be honest about where we excel and where competitors might have advantages, but position our strengths effectively.

SARAH: I like this approach. What about frequency? Are we still thinking two blog posts per week?

LISA: I'd actually like to experiment with less frequent but higher quality content. Maybe one really comprehensive piece per week, plus some shorter supporting content like social posts and email content.

EMILY: That could work well with email marketing. One major piece per week gives us a strong centerpiece for the weekly newsletter.

JAMES: And more substantial content tends to perform better on LinkedIn. Those 2000-word thought leadership pieces get much more engagement than short updates.

SARAH: Alright, let's try that approach for Q1 and measure the results. Now, I want to talk about budget allocation for the quarter.

We have $75,000 for Q1 digital marketing. Based on our discussion today, here's how I'm thinking we split it:

Video content production - $45,000 for the quarter
Marketing automation platform - $2,400 for setup and three months
Paid advertising - $20,000
Content creation tools and resources - $7,600

Does that seem reasonable to everyone?

DAVID: That's a pretty big investment in video. Are we confident we'll see the ROI?

SARAH: It's definitely a risk, but the potential upside is huge. And we can always adjust if we're not seeing results after month one.

MIKE: I think it's worth testing. We've been talking about video for months but never committed. Let's give it a real shot.

JENNIFER: Can we maybe start with a smaller test? Like $30,000 for video and see how it goes?

SARAH: That's a good compromise. We could start with $30,000, and if it's working well, invest the additional $15,000 in month two.

EMILY: That leaves us more budget for paid advertising too, which has been consistently profitable for us.

SARAH: Good point. Let's plan $30,000 for video, and $35,000 for paid ads. That gives us more flexibility.

Now, let's talk about timeline and responsibilities. I want to have our video strategy launched by January 15th. James, can you work with the video agency on content planning?

JAMES: Absolutely. I'll set up initial meetings next week.

SARAH: Lisa, when can we have the new content calendar ready?

LISA: I can have a draft by December 1st, final version by December 10th.

SARAH: Perfect. Emily, what's your timeline for evaluating and potentially implementing marketing automation?

EMILY: I'd like to do a full demo of HubSpot next week, then make a recommendation by November 30th. If we move forward, implementation would probably take 3-4 weeks.

SARAH: Great. David, can you set up the tracking and analytics framework for our new initiatives?

DAVID: Yes, I'll have measurement plans for video and automation ready by December 5th.

SARAH: Excellent. Mike and Jennifer, I'd like you both to collaborate on messaging and positioning for our Q1 campaigns. Can you sync up next week?

MIKE: Works for me.

JENNIFER: Same here. I'll send you my calendar.

SARAH: Alright, before we wrap up, let me make sure I captured everything correctly. Our key initiatives for Q1 are:

One, launch a comprehensive video marketing strategy with 2-3 videos per week
Two, implement marketing automation for better lead nurturing and scoring  
Three, restructure our content mix to include more consideration and decision-stage content
Four, maintain our successful email and SEO strategies while optimizing paid advertising

Does that cover everything?

LISA: I think we should also set up monthly check-ins to review performance and adjust strategies as needed.

SARAH: Great suggestion. Let's schedule monthly strategy reviews for the first Friday of each month, starting January 3rd.

DAVID: Should we set specific KPI targets for each initiative?

SARAH: Yes, let's do that offline. David, can you work with each team member to set realistic but ambitious targets for their areas?

DAVID: Sure thing.

SARAH: Any other questions or concerns before we adjourn?

EMILY: Just want to confirm - are we keeping the same overall goals for Q1? Lead generation target of 500 qualified leads, revenue attribution target of $200,000?

SARAH: Yes, those targets stay the same. But with our new strategies, I'm optimistic we might exceed them.

MIKE: I'm excited about this plan. Feels like we're finally taking some bigger swings instead of just incrementally improving.

JENNIFER: Agreed. The video strategy especially feels like it could be a game-changer for brand awareness.

SARAH: That's exactly the mindset I was hoping for. We've been playing it safe, but our competition isn't standing still. It's time to innovate.

Alright everyone, thanks for a productive session. I'll send out meeting notes by end of day tomorrow with all the action items and timelines we discussed.

Our next team meeting is December 10th where we'll review progress on all these initiatives. Have a great rest of your week!
